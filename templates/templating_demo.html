    <h1>Welcome to YetAnotherInfoSite!</h1>
    
    <p>In today's age, it can be difficult to find reliable information between the muddled waters of politics. With this in mind, the objective of yetanotherinfosite(YAIS) is to provide people well researched and sourced historical information from 1900 to the 1950's. History is important as the events that occured in the past have a major effect on what we will do in the future. From the court of law, to policy makers, to inter-national politics, history is used as a reference for major decisions in the modern world. It teaches us what to do and what not to do, and much of the history that has happened affects us today. Today history is seen as very unimportant. The reality of it, is that history guides our future. Our world today faces many problems, and the first thing to do to solve a problem, is to understand that problem. History is our window that allows us to see and understand the problems that face our world through the eyes of the past. Today, as lines between fact and fiction are drawn, it is more important than ever to ensure that the truth continues on. You may ask, why the 1900 to 1950's? This time period is chosen to show how even events that may seem distant have constant persistant effects on world history today. That the actions and beliefs of historic individuals are still carried, for better or worse, by many of their modern contemporaries. It is to show that kicking a problem into the future, doesn't work. It is to prove that the past is not something to be forgotten and then changed into whatever fits your will, rather it is a set period of events that have changed not only our lives, but also our world.</p>
