    <p>My intent behind the website was to create a place where reliable historical information is available. I have always been interested in history, especially about how so many people in, relatively, recent history have had a massive impact on our society and even our way of thinking, and yet many people don't awknowledge them. I also wanted to show people how history can be very important to our modern life by showing how many simple decisions made by a few individuals can change our world. I will be the first to admit that I am not good with this coding and get frustrated easily when working on this project. It is nowhere near what I wanted to make. If I were to continue this, I would want to find a way to make the chart work better. Right now I managed to get it to work on all platforms, but I had to sacrifice the ability to make it completely fluid. I also am having problems with dynamically changing data as I don't understand how to make the chart recieve data from a database and then change it on the __init__.py.</p>
